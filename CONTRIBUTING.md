# Purpose and Goal
This list aims to provide an overview of the best resources for quantum computing. Someone out of touch or unfamiliar with quantum computing should be able to look at this list and find:
- Starting points to explore from and resources to consume.
- The best tools and packages to work with.
- The most up-to-date resources and guides.

Because of this goal, contributions from the community are welcomed and wanted!
